## Flights Project 
Hi,
I enclose here the project I worked on days and nights of investment and learning a new language,
The PHP server side ran great and the Angular also ran really well on Monday, 
but I got tangled up with the section of the connection between them despite all the trials,
The much time and effort I put into it in so little time that was allotted to me, it did not work,
even though I think I wrote the right code for it ...
(I just know more about the connection between Angular and #C with which we are working on our final project.)
For some of the functions I wrote an explanation in words what they are supposed to perform,
but again from the angular all the functions run.
So I would be really happy if you check the code itself more in depth in PHP and Angular without delaying the connection between them.
I will be happy to make the connection if you want later ...
Thank you very much for the opportunity to get to know a new and interesting language, and to do a project I really enjoyed !!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Š
